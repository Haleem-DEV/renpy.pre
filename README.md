# renpy.pre
This is about my experience with the final project. 
I chose this as my final project becuase it was something that I have never done before. I have never made any type story nor have i used renpy. Some challenges that I faced were creating the story and getting it done on time. My favorite part about the story is that i made multiple endings and different branches to the story. I learned that I like to write and create stories. This project helped me find a new passion I didn't know I had. Thank you for the experience.
